## First route matching

```bash
php run-first-tests.php
```

This benchmark tests how quickly each router can match the first route. 1,000 routes each with 9 arguments.

This benchmark consists of 16 tests. Each test is executed 1,000 times, the results pruned, and then averaged. Values that fall outside of 3 standard deviations of the mean are discarded.

## Worst-case matching

```php
$ php run-worst-tests.php
```

This benchmark matches the last route and unknown route. It generates a randomly prefixed and suffixed route in an attempt to thwart any optimization. 1,000 routes each with 9 arguments.

This benchmark consists of 32 tests. Each test is executed 1,000 times, the results pruned, and then averaged. Values that fall outside of 3 standard deviations of the mean are discarded.
