PHP Router Benchmark
====================

The intent here is to benchmark different PHP routing solutions. This is a micro-optimization, done purely out of 
dumb curiosity.

## Question

class `Nice\Benchmark` 87-89 line(bug):

```php
    $start = microtime(1);
    $test->run($this->parameters);
    $testResults[] = round(microtime(1) - $start, 10);
```

Installation
------------

Clone the repo, run `composer install`, run `php run-tests.php`.

You can install the [Pux](https://github.com/c9s/pux) extension to test that as well. If the extension is not
installed, the tests will fallback to the pure PHP implementation of Pux.

To test the [R3 library](https://github.com/c9s/php-r3), you also need to install that extension. If the extension is
not installed, the tests for R3 will be skipped.

Currently
---------

The current test creates 1000 routes, each with a randomized prefix and postfix, with 9 parameters each.

It was run with the [Pux](https://github.com/c9s/pux) and [R3](https://github.com/c9s/php-r3) extensions enabled.

An example route: `/9b37eef21e/{arg1}/{arg2}/{arg3}/{arg4}/{arg5}/{arg6}/{arg7}/{arg8}/{arg9}/bda37e9f9b`

## Worst-case matching
This benchmark matches the last route and unknown route. It generates a randomly prefixed and suffixed route in an attempt to thwart any optimization. 1,000 routes each with 9 arguments.

This benchmark consists of 12 tests. Each test is executed 1,000 times, the results pruned, and then averaged. Values that fall outside of 3 standard deviations of the mean are discarded.

## First route matching
This benchmark tests how quickly each router can match the first route. 1,000 routes each with 9 arguments.

This benchmark consists of 6 tests. Each test is executed 1,000 times, the results pruned, and then averaged. Values that fall outside of 3 standard deviations of the mean are discarded.


Test Name | Results | Time | + Interval | Change
